### Hi all ðŸ––

## An Intro...
- Data Architect & Data Engineer for GAVB / Grupo BoticÃ¡rio
- 10+ yrs as SQL Server DBA
- An avid learner (I'm studying more than I can handle, but that's the point, don't you think? ðŸ˜¬)
- Trying to learn Russian in the meantime
- I'll try to make this git as updated as possible, with all the projects I'm studying. Go check my repos!
